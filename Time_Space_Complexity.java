/* Time Complexity- Time taken by an algorithm as a function of the length of input.
a. f(n)=3n^2+5n -> Ingnore constants and focus on the maximum power then time complexity would be-> Big O(n^2)
b. f(n)=n+100log n -> n is greater beacuse if we make the graph of this function log n will always below the n it would be downgrading graph so TC would be Big O(n).
c. f(n)=1000000 -> for this type of function TC would be O(1) coz 100000 is a constant value.
Some other examples for O(n)=n/4, (n+100)/4, 5n+2log n
Some other examples for O(n^2)=5n^2+7n+2, 3n^2+2n, n^2/100
Note- Big O notation works on worst case because that vo case hi sabse jyada time lega,to idea ye hota h ki minimum kitna bhi time le algo but atmost(worst case) itna to
time legi hi legi.
